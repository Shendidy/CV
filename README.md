## About me

With a BSc in civil engineering, and as projects manager for the past 12 years in one of the most challenging and dynamic industries in the world and in the most robust city of Dubai, I'm determined to live my life now doing what I enjoy the most and start a career in the software development. Bringing with me all life and professional skills  gained over the years, along with what I learnt at Makers academy and before that as a hobyist software developer.

A lot more about me can be found on my site: [shendidy.com](http://www.shendidy.com)

## Skills

#### Self Teaching

Since childhood I was so attracted to software development, and started with Basic on my commodore 64 back in the 80s. Later on in university I started reading books about C, then C++. As well as working for free during a summer holiday in a hardware company fixing desktop systems from scratch depending on the specifications set by our clients and installing all required software and operating system.

Later on I started learning Visual Studio and wrote few programs using Visual C#, 2 of which are [Text Guard lite](http://shendidy.com/software/textguardlite.html), and [Vapulator](http://www.shendidy.com/software/vapulator.html).

I also taught myself a bit of flash and developed a very simple and basic online game [Maya in the Park](http://www.shendidy.com/games/mip.html), then my biggest challenge was when I wanted to start a free online lottery site where members can fill their free tickets weekly, connect with other players and earn more tickets, check their current and previous tickets, check any winnings, claiming their prize if any, and many other options. To do that I researched and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MYSQL. From the moment I had the website idea to launch it took me 9 months of learning and implementation during my free time of a 6 days a week very demanding job. Check it out at [BigBOF](https://www.bigbof.com).

#### Problem Solving

I believe that without problems, there will be no jobs for us out there, so they never scare me, they just tease my brain, and the harder the challenge, the more I get excited and commit to finding the best solution.

With this mindset, I managed to develop a stable, calm, and analytical approach to solving problems I face on my day to day life, or at work, asking the basic questions of:

- How they started (or what is the final requirement).
- What are the possible solutions and what are their consequences.
- Which one/s is/are the most relevant to the case I have in hand.
- What are the costs of each possible solution (money, time, memory, clarity of code, ease of use and integration with other parts of the project)
- Decide and start implementing the solution, while testing it regularly during implementation.
- Monitoring the performance after implementing a solution and ensuring it's inline with our requirements/expectations.

#### Team member/manager

I bring with me the skills I developed as a team member/manager over the years as a project manager in one of the toughest industries in the world, and after working with people from so many different backgrounds in the UK, or in Dubai (U.A.E.).

The way I always preferred to manage my teams was to lead by example and ensure all my team members are comfortable sharing their thoughts and suggestions, especially when they contradict mine. Respect, communication, and engaging were always my tools to ensure everyone is putting in 110% of their efforts.

#### Time/Risks/Priorities Management

"NO" is an answer that can almost always have a negative vibe around it. However, to successfully manage my time and priorities I developed the art of knowing how and when to say it, without stopping the progress of activities that must keep on going.

proposing alternatives, rescheduling tasks based on risks, priorities, and subsequent effects on the overall works schedule, delegation, and discussing available options are my approaches to such regular situations.

#### Communication

I'm confidently able to communicate with people (my team, managers, clients, and contractors) and ensuring I have all required information, or delivered all details to other stakeholders.

I believe that communication is not just about delivering or receiving messages, it's about understanding all details associated with the subject and ensuring the receiving party has understood all these details. Or if I'm on the receiving side, that I understood all the requirements, asked questions to clarify any ambiguities and milestones, analysed them and drafted a plan for delivering it, along with the required resources.

## Hobbies and Interests
- **Coding:**

    I always had huge interest in learning how to code, and whenever I had spare time and an idea of a program, I'd spend hours just putting my thoughts into action until the final software is running. I wouldn't feel the time passing by and enjoy every minute of solving the problems that come my way.
- **Flying:**

    My other childhood obsession was with flying, and I managed to make my dream come true in 2009 when I got my PPL (Private Pilot Licence) allowing me to fly my family and friends in single engine airplanes.
- **Diving:**

    One of the quietest and calmest experiences you can ever have is diving 40 feet below water and merging with the beautiful nature and creatures living in harmony far away from all the pollution generated by humans. With my Padi Advanced Diver qualification I grab any opportunity to dive whenever possible, particularly when I visit the red sea in Egypt.
- **Reading:**

    When I get a chance, I enjoy reading for authors like Dan Brown, and Sidney Sheldon.
- **Walking:**

    Whenever possible, I prefer to go to my destinations walking. And in the weekends I take my family to walk around beautiful parks or to explore London city.
