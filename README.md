## About me

Coming to the coding community from the construction industry with a BSc. in civil engineering and where I held the position of project manager for more than 10 years without finding joy and only succeeded due to my dedication and strive to success rather than passion and innovation. Now I’m so determined to live my life doing what I enjoy the most, developing any and all types of software, while working with a team of likeminded people that enjoy putting their brains together to solve problems and deliver a perfect product.

I am a conscientious and hardworking person who’s also able to operate with people at all levels within an organisation and able to gain people's respect and trust. Positive, analytical, problem solving thinker, and quick learner. Equally happy to develop and grow within a project or undertake one and produce the desired results within a specific time frame, while keeping my company’s interests fulfilled and keeping accurate and detailed records of claims or variations leading situations.

Possessing strong communication, planning, management, and organisational skills gained over several years of professional hard work in the UK, and the Middle East. With the ability to work and integrate in the most challenging and multi-cultural environments, and to develop a great rapport with my colleagues and clients alike.

## Skills

#### Self Teaching

Since childhood I was so attracted to software development, and started with Basic on my commodore 64 back in the 80s. Later on in university I started reading books about C, then C++. As well as working for free during a summer holiday in a hardware company fixing desktop systems from scratch depending on the specifications set by our clients and installing all required software and operating system.

Later on I started learning Visual Studio and wrote few programs using Visual C#, 2 of which are [Text Guard lite](http://shendidy.com/software/textguardlite.html), and [Vapulator](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Others/Home-Education/Vapulator.shtml).

I also taught myself a bit of flash and developed a very simple and basic online game [Maya in the Park](http://www.shendidy.com/games/mip.html), then my biggest challenge was when I wanted to start a free online lottery site where members can fill their free tickets weekly, connect with other players and earn more tickets, check their current and previous tickets, check any winnings, claiming their prize if any, and many other options. To do that I researched and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MYSQL. From the moment I had the website idea to launch it took me 9 months of learning and implementation during my free time of a 6 days a week very demanding job. Check it out at [BigBOF](https://www.bigbof.com).

#### Team member/manager

I bring with me the skills I developed as a team member/manager over the years as a project manager in one of the toughest industries in the world, and after working with people from so many different backgrounds in the UK, or in Dubai (U.A.E.).

The way I always preferred to manage my teams was to lead by example and ensure all my team members are comfortable sharing their thoughts and suggestions, especially when they contradict mine. Respect, communication, and engaging were always my tools to ensure everyone is putting in 110% of their efforts.

#### Time/Risks/Priorities Management

"NO" is an answer that can almost always have a negative vibe around it. However, to successfully manage my time and priorities I developed the art of knowing how and when to say it, without stopping the progress of activities that must keep on going.

proposing alternatives, rescheduling tasks based on risks, priorities, and subsequent effects on the overall works schedule, delegating, and discussing available options are my approaches to such regular situations.

#### Communication

I have very good ability to communicate with people (my team, managers, clients, and contractors) and ensuring I have all required information, or delivered all details to other stakeholders.

I believe that communication is not just about delivering or receiving messages, it's about understanding all details associated with the subject and ensuring the receiving party has understood all these details. Or if I'm on the receiving side, that I understood all the requirements, and quickly analysed them and drafted a plan for delivering it, and the resources required.

#### Problem Solving

I believe that without problems, there will be no jobs for us out there, so they never scare me, they just tease my brain, and the harder the challenge, the more I get excited.

With this mindset, I managed to develop a stable, calm, and analytical approach to solving problems I face on my day to day life, or at work, asking the basic questions of:

- How they started (or what is the final requirement).
- What are the possible solutions and what are their consequences.
- Which one/s is/are the most relevant to the case I have in hand.
- What are the costs of each possible solution (money, time, memory, clarity of code, ease of use and integration with other parts of the project)
- Decide and start implementing the solution, while testing it regularly during implementation.
