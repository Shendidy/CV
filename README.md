## About me

Coming to the coding community from the construction industry with a BSc. in civil engineering and where I held the position of project manager for more than 10 years without finding joy and only succeeded due to my dedication and strive to success rather than passion and innovation. Now Iâ€™m so determined to live my life doing what I enjoy the most, developing any and all types of software, while working with a team of likeminded people that enjoy putting their brains together to solve problems and deliver a perfect product.

## Skills

#### Self Teaching

Since childhood I was so attracted to programming, and started with Basic on my commodore 64 back in the 80s. Later on in university I started reading books about C, then C++.

Later on I started learning Visual Studio and wrote few software using Visual C#, 2 of which are [Text Guard lite](http://shendidy.com/software/textguardlite.html), and [Vapulator](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Others/Home-Education/Vapulator.shtml).

I also taught myself a bit of flash and developed a very simple and basic online game [Maya in the Park](http://www.shendidy.com/games/mip.html), then my biggest challenge was when I wanted to start a free online lottery site where members can fill their free tickets weekly, can connect with other players and earn more tickets, check their current and previous tickets, and many other options. To do that I researched and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MYSQL. check it out at [BigBOF](https://www.bigbof.com).
